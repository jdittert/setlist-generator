# Set List Generator

## Description
[Set List Generator](https://jdittert.github.io/setlist-generator/) allows users to create a master list of songs and then generate set lists of a user-specified length (number of minutes or number of songs) based on the master list. Users can import songs individually or import a Spotify playlist.

The project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

Much of the code was written by [Chat GPT 3.5](https://chat.openai.com/). I assembled and edited the code to create the finished product. I used Chat GPT for this project to get used to its interface and its product.
